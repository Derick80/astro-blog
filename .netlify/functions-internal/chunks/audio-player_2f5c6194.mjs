I also want to learn more about electronics and coding.\n\nI asked ChatGPT for help with this and it suggested the following:\n\nChoose the hardware components: The first step is to choose the hardware components that you will use to build your iPod. This includes a circuit board, display screen, battery, storage drive, audio codec, and other necessary components. You may also need to purchase special tools and equipment, such as a soldering iron, multimeter, and wire strippers.\n\nI asked ChatGPT which audio codec to use with my collection and it was suggested to use Ogg Vorbis or Opus. So obviously, I asked which one is better and here's what ChatGPT said:\n\nOgg Vorbis is a well-established codec that has been around for many years. It is a free and open-source codec that offers high-quality audio at lower bit rates than other codecs such as MP3. It is compatible with a wide range of devices and media players and is a popular choice among audiophiles and music enthusiasts.\n";
