Although I am not well-versed in the artist's background beyond the details presented in the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haroon_Mirza) article and the exhibit's information panel, I was thoroughly impressed by the exhibit.\n\nThe installation itself is particularly noteworthy for its use of vibrations, with the entire display resonating at a consistent frequency. There is also fascinating archaeological evidence that suggests that this frequency may have been used in ancient artifacts, making the exhibit even more intriguing.\n\n![exhibit image](/exhibit.webp)\n";
