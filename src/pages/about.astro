<p>I was born in western New York state but have lived and attended school in Missouri and Boston.<p>I completed my undergraduate degree at the <a target="_blank" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.umb.edu\">University of Massachusetts Boston</a>, where I focused on biology and <em>almost </em>minored in biochemistry.</p><p>I attended <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://gsbs.tufts.edu/\">Tufts Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences </a>where I studied mRNA processing in yeast and earned my phD.</p><p>I worked as a post doctoral student at The <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://personalizedmedicine.partners.org/laboratory-for-molecular-medicine/\">Laboratory for Molecular Medicine</a> at Harvard Medical School.</p><>After a couple of years I used my skill in interpreting genomic variants to join a small start up called <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tempus.com/\">Tempus labs</a>. It's been five years and I have expanded the breadth of my understanding in genetics and have fostered emergent coding skills. I have used those skills to create new assays, support automation in production, and improve processes in between. I'm really excited about the future in genetics and web development. I hope to find a really great position where I can use my fantastic scientific knowledge to inform data analysis, display and the development of modern web applications to view and use the data.
